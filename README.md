# MechGame
Baby's first game

Up to date!

Things to do:
- Too many... look for TODO's in files
- Prep for first test (in level scene, hangar later...)
	- Everything else (high priority)
		- Rename Weapon connection points "Connection_012" & check other names	
		- Emplace ScriptableVariables
	- File read (med priority)
		- Build from default if needed
		- Check & update managers
	- Animators (low priority)
